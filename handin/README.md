Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 

Hello All!

I'm in the first semester of our program. I'm always interested in discussing how data science applies to different domains along with the ethics and impact of it all.

I'm excited to be working with everyone!
